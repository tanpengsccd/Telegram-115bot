## Update Log
v3.1.0
- Removed AV subscription feature, added AV daily update functionality that automatically updates and downloads the latest resources to 115 daily, can be enabled or disabled in the configuration file. If the offline download fails, the bot will retry every 6 hours until successful.
- Added direct AV number offline download feature, input 'av ipz-266' to automatically download to 115, eliminating the need to search for magnet links
- A new “Retry List” feature has been added. When offline access fails, you can add it to the retry list, and the robot will attempt offline access again after a fixed interval. When you no longer need it, you can clear this list at any time.
- Added bot menu
- Code optimization and bug fixes

v3.0.0

## Background
This project originated from the need to optimize personal daily viewing experience. As a movie enthusiast, I use the combination of 115 Network Disk + CloudDrive2 + Emby to manage and watch media content.

Imagine this scenario:

While commuting, you come across an interesting movie. Simply send the magnet link to the TG bot, and it will:
- Automatically download the movie to the specified category directory in 115 Network Disk
- Intelligently clean up advertisement files
- Automatically create STRM files and notify Emby for media library scanning

When you return home after work, just prepare some snacks and drinks, open Emby, and enjoy a well-organized viewing experience. Let a good movie wash away your daily fatigue and help you relax.

## Known Issues
- Limited support for TV series. Downloading series directly may cause unexpected issues
- Directory synchronization will clear the entire folder, including metadata (quite aggressive)

## Usage Guide

### Basic Commands

- `/start`   - Show help information
- `/auth`    - 115 authorization setup
- `/dl`      - Add offline download
- `/av`      - AV number download
- `/sync`    - Sync directory and create symlinks
- `/sm`      - Subscribe to movies
- `/q`       - Cancel current session

### 115 Open Platform Application

**Strongly recommend applying for 115 Open Platform** for better user experience:
- Application URL: [115 Open Platform](https://open.115.com/)
- After approval, fill in the `115_app_id` in the configuration file

If you don't want to use the 115 Open Platform, please use the previous image version `qiqiandfei/115-bot:v2.3.7`

### Video Download Configuration

Due to Telegram Bot API limitations, videos larger than 20MB cannot be downloaded. To download large videos, please configure the Telegram client:

#### Configuration
Telegram API application address: [Telegram Development Platform](https://my.telegram.org/auth)

When your application is successful, you will receive a “tg_api_id” and “tg_api_hash”.

Ensure that these three parameters are correct:
```
# bot_name
bot_name: "@yourbotname"

# telegram api info
tg_api_id: 1122334
tg_api_hash: 1yh3j4k9dsk0fj3jdufnwrhf62j1k33f
```

> **Note**: If you don't configure this step, the bot will still work normally, but cannot handle video files larger than 20MB.

### Important Warning

⚠️ **Synchronization Function Warning**: The `/sync` command will **delete all files in the target directory**, including metadata. Large-scale synchronization operations may trigger 115 Network Disk's risk control mechanism, please use with caution!
